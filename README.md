# 🏛️ Federal Regulatory Insights Engine

### *A Cloud-Native RegTech System for Quantifying Administrative Burden in U.S. Federal Regulations*

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Federal Regulatory Insights Engine** is a regulatory intelligence system that analyzes the *Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)* and transforms unstructured legal text into measurable computational signals of regulatory complexity.

It introduces a metric called **Requirement Density (RD)** to quantify administrative burden across federal agencies using NLP-based heuristics.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Regulatory documents are:

* Large-scale and continuously evolving
* Difficult to analyze quantitatively
* Written in highly unstructured legal language

There is no standardized computational metric to evaluate **regulatory strictness or compliance burden** across agencies.

---

## 💡 Solution

This system:

* Ingests eCFR regulatory datasets
* Extracts prescriptive legal language using NLP heuristics
* Computes **Requirement Density (RD)**
* Flags high-burden agencies
* Displays insights via a real-time dashboard

---

## 📊 Requirement Density (RD)

 ```text
        Prescriptive Keywords
RD = -----------------------------
             Total Word Count
```

### 📌 Interpretation

* Higher RD → more regulatory burden
* Lower RD → less prescriptive regulation

### 🔎 Keywords used

`shall`, `must`, `prohibited`, `penalty`, `compliance`

## ☁️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Terraform is used to provision and manage cloud resources:

- AWS ECR for Docker image registry
- AWS S3 for dataset storage

This enables reproducible infrastructure and version-controlled deployments.

📦 System Boundary

External:
- eCFR dataset (source of regulatory data)

Internal:
- NLP engine
- RD computation system
- Dashboard + API

The system processes external regulatory data into structured analytical insights.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 📊 Regulatory burden quantification (RD metric)
* ⚡ Parallel processing of agency datasets
* 🔍 NLP-based legal language extraction
* 🧾 SHA-256 dataset integrity validation
* 🚨 High-burden agency classification engine
* 📡 Real-time dashboard visualization

---

## ⚙️ Engineering Decisions

### 🧠 Stateless Design

The system is designed as a stateless API. Each request is processed independently.  
H2 is used only for development and does not represent persistent system state.

---

### 🗄️ Database Strategy

* H2 used for **fast, ephemeral computation**
* No persistent storage required for current workload
* Future-ready for PostgreSQL migration if audit/history is required

---

### ⚡ Performance Optimization

* Java Parallel Streams used for concurrent data ingestion
* Reduces latency for multi-agency analysis

---

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment (Render)

* Dockerized application for portability
* Dynamic port binding for cloud environments:

```properties
server.port=${PORT:8080}
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* SQL injection mitigated via Spring Data JPA parameter binding
* Stateless API reduces session-based attack surface
* HTTPS-ready deployment architecture
* Future: encryption-at-rest for regulatory datasets

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Local Run

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker build -t reg-engine .
docker run -p 8080:8080 reg-engine
```

---

## 🧭 Tradeoffs

| Decision         | Tradeoff                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| H2 DB            | Speed vs persistence              |
| Stateless design | Scalability vs auditability       |
| Rule-based NLP   | Interpretability vs ML complexity |
| Parallel streams | Performance vs thread overhead    |

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* PostgreSQL-based regulatory history tracking
* Versioned regulation change detection system
* Kafka-based ingestion pipeline
* ML-based classification of regulatory complexity
* Role-based access control (enterprise upgrade)

---

## 🧠 Summary

The Federal Regulatory Insights Engine demonstrates how **NLP, systems design, and economic theory** can be combined to quantify regulatory complexity.

It is designed as a **cloud-native, stateless analytics engine** with a clear path toward enterprise-grade persistence and governance features.
